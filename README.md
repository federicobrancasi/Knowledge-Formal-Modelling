# Knowledge Formal Modelling

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and accompanying Python scripts dedicated to generating graphs that represent formal models of the real world. These resources have been created for Professor Fausto Giunchiglia from the University of Trento and explore various methodologies and models for knowledge modelling.

## Contents

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

### WordNet: Semantic Relationships in Linguistic Concepts

- **WordNet PART-OF Relationship**
  - **[Wordnet_PART-OF_Relationship.py](Wordnet_PART-OF_Relationship.py):** Python script for WordNet PART-OF Relationship modelling.
- **WordNet IS-A + PART-OF Relationships**
  - **[Wordnet_IS-A+PART-OF_Relationships.py](Wordnet_IS-A+PART-OF_Relationships.py):** Python script for WordNet IS-A + PART-OF Relationships modelling.

### UKC (Universal Knowledge Core): Multilingual, Diversity-Aware Lexical Resource

Introduces a multilingual, diversity-aware lexical resource to represent global knowledge.

- **UKC IS-A Relationship**
  - **[UKC_IS-A_Relationship.py](UKC_IS-A_Relationship.py):** Python script for UKC IS-A Relationship modelling.
- **UKC IS-A Relationship (Reduced Version)**

- **UKC PART-OF Relationship**
  - **[UKC_PART-OF_Relationship.py](UKC_PART-OF_Relationship.py):** Python script for UKC PART-OF Relationship modelling.
- **UKC IS-A + PART-OF Relationships**
  - **[UKC_IS-A+PART-OF_Relationships.py](UKC_IS-A+PART-OF_Relationships.py):** Python script for UKC IS-A + PART-OF Relationships modelling.

### Language Teleology: Goals and Purposes in Language Structure

Analyzes purposes and goals within the structure of language.

- **[Language_Teleology.py](Language_Teleology.py):** Python script for Language Teleology modelling.

### Knowledge Teleology / EER Model: Enhanced Entity-Relationship Modelling

Illustrates how entities, relationships and attributes are organised and interconnected to represent complex knowledge domains.

- **[Knowledge_Teleology.py](Knowledge_Teleology.py):** Python script for Knowledge Teleology.

### Teleontology / ETG Knowledge Graph / ER Model: Event-Oriented Knowledge Modelling

Here we present the ETG Knowledge Graph, which integrates events, entities and relationships to provide a semantic representation of complex and interconnected knowledge.

- **ETG Knowledge Graph**
  - **[ETG_Knowledge_Graph.py](ETG_Knowledge_Graph.py):** Python script for ETG Knowledge Graph modelling.
- **ER Model**
  - **[ER_Model.py](ER_Model.py):** Python script for ER Model.

### EG Knowledge Graph / Database: Real-World Data Representation

Explores the EG Knowledge Graph as a tool for managing real-world data.

- **[EG_Knowledge_Graph.py](EG_Knowledge_Graph.py):** Python script for EG Knowledge Graph modelling.

### Conclusions: Importance of Knowledge Graphs

Summarizes key concepts discussed in the notebook and discusses the importance of Knowledge Graphs in representing structured knowledge.
